# ideas for applying metroani to portfolio

1. timeline of my experiences
   stations = one historical event (eg dissertation)
   lines = programming language
   this could also be an entire metro map

at least, can also turn the portfolio into a timeline based one, with work and personal projects interspersed

2. skills
   station = skill (eg python)

# problems

- what kind of interactivity? what should clicking on stations do? does having animations interfere with interactivity?
- english text is not really good for vertical japanese text
